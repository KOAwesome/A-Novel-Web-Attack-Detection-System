**EDL-WADS: Ensemble Deep Learning-based Web Attack Detection System for IoT**

The Internet of Things (IoT) has witnessed explosive growth, empowering millions of devices to communicate and provide unprecedented functionalities. Leveraging big data analysis, IoT networks aim to deliver intelligent and real-time operations by collecting data from diverse devices. However, the complexity and diversity of IoT environments make them more susceptible to various online attacks compared to traditional computer networks.
Introduction

To address the security challenges faced by IoT networks, we introduce EDL-WADS (Ensemble Deep Learning-based Web Attack Detection System). This system is designed to detect and mitigate a variety of online threats using advanced ensemble algorithms and deep learning techniques.

**Key Features**
1. Ensemble Deep Learning: EDL-WADS utilizes a combination of deep learning and ensemble algorithms to enhance the accuracy and robustness of attack detection.

2. Real-time Protection: The system actively monitors IoT networks in real time, providing timely responses to potential security threats.

3. User-friendly Interface: The front-end interface is built using the Django framework, ensuring a simple and intuitive experience for users managing and securing their IoT devices.

**Getting Started**
